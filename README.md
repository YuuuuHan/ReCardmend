# ReCardmend
In recent years, the use of credit cards as a medium of exchange has become increasingly popular. Considering the fact that people holding multiple credit cards canâ€˜t absorb such a large amount of credit card reward in a short period of time, we have developed a system that **recommends credit card reward according to the needs of users**.
## Illustrate
Users can **add the credit cards** they have and **select the locations** where they want to make purchases. In this way, the system will **list the credit card reward** based on the cards they have when they make purchases at the location.
## Responsible
We are a team of four people, and I am mainly responsible for **crawling credit card reward from three banks using crawler technique**, and then **pre-processing the data and database management**.
